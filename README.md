**How to setup SiakJover?**

### 1. Download Required Files

   - **Get Python**: This code runs on Python, so you'll need to have it installed. If you donâ€™t have it, download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. An IDE is a bonus but not required.
   - **Download SiakJover**: You can clone the repository (You will need to download git for it https://git-scm.com/downloads. PLEASE download based on your OS) or download the ZIP file (dm me via discord if enconter problem, sl1ckthread) 
```
git clone https://github.com/Sl1ckThread/SiakJover.git
```

   - **Open Terminal** : Open command prompt or terminal depending on your operating system
   - **Navigate to the Folder**: Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and change the directory to your SiakJover folder using:

```
cd siakjover/siakwar
```


### 2. Install Required Python Libraries

   Youâ€™ll need a couple of Python libraries. Run the following commands in your command prompt or terminal:
```
pip install selenium
```
   Add `--user` behind it if you encounter error installing the library

### 3. Configure the `config.txt` File

   Open the `config.txt` file and update it with your username, password, and subject codes. You can find it by going to the directory  stated on the terminal
   
![how to navigate to config](./ignore/configedit.png)

   To find the matkul code you are looking forward can be found by hovering the subject you want
   
![how to find matkul code](./ignore/matkulcode.png)

   On the config.txt, you will be asked for matkulcode. To clarify, based on the picture above `749849` is the value you found on the picture above and `-2` is the sks

### 4. Run the Program

   - Execute the program using the command:
```
     python siakjover.py
```
`If you are NOT on windows`, please download the correct chromedriver based on your operating system (linux/mac) on https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
<br> Replace the current chromedriver in the folder with the one you installed (also on testground)
### 5. Follow the Prompts

   - The program will automatically open a browser window and try to log in using the credentials from `config.txt`.
   - It will then navigate to the course selection page and start selecting subjects based on the codes you provided.
   - If there are issues with logging in or finding subjects, the program will show error messages.
   - After the codes have been selected, it will auto submit. `If codes isnt found, it will not auto submit`
   - CTRL+C to stop the program entirely 
   

## Whatsupp with testground?

I have created a specific folder for you to test the code. Please make sure to edit the `config.txt` file INSIDE the testground folder as needed. Then, navigate to the testground directory in your terminal by running `cd testground`, and execute the script with `python siakjover.py`.

To test the changes for the matkul code, run the Python file first and hover over the desired matkul code you want to test.

## Warnings!!

Do not `Go back one page` or you will break the program

## Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Verify that your username and password in `config.txt` are correct. Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- **Browser Issues**: Make sure Chrome and ChromeDriver are properly installed and up-to-date.
- **Non-Windows Users**: If you're not on Windows, download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your operating system (Linux/macOS). Place the ChromeDriver executable in the SiakJover folder and, if needed, the testground folder for testing purposes.
- **Program Errors**: If an error occurs, it will be printed in the console. Check these messages for guidance.
- **Terminal Errors** : If for somewhat reason your terminal went stuck and unable to load and want to restart the program, press `Ctrl+C` on the terminal to keyboardinterrupt
